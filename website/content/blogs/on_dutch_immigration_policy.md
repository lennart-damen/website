title: 'On Dutch immigration policy'
---

If you know me, you know that I generally refrain from having opinions on topics that I do not know much about. However, with the recent shift of power in the Dutch government towards right-wing populist (and [openly racist](https://watwilwilders.nl/WildersdiscrimineertMoslims.html)) parties, I feel that some of the values I care about are under pressure. I talked about this topic with some colleagues (during Christmas dinner, after a few glasses of wine), and wanted to share some of my concerns with you.

I find it difficult to articulate my general feeling of uneasiness. Instead, I chose two to highlight two developments that worry me.

- [The motion Becker](https://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerstukken/moties/detail?id=2024Z19345&did=2024D46011)
- [The freeze of asylum requests from Syrian refugees one single day after the fall of Assad's regime](https://ind.nl/nl/nieuws/voorlopig-geen-beslissing-op-asielaanvragen-syrie)

# The motion Becker
The motion ([defition](https://www.parlement.com/id/vh8lnhrogvv2/motie)) Becker requests the government "... to collect data about cultural/religious values of Dutch citizens with a migration background, for example by asking {institution} to (periodically) carry out this investigation"

I have several issues with the framing of this motion:
- It is unconstitutional, because it does not treat all those that reside in the Netherlands as equal. While I do agree that collecting census data may help to improve the integration process, I do not think any laws should be framed around targeting specific parts of the population. This sends a message of division to both native and immigrated inhabitants of the Netherlands.
- It is ambiguous*, and therefore susceptible to abuse of power by either current or future governments. Even though I believe Becker's idea may be well intended (which I do believe watching [her reaction to the backlash](https://x.com/bentebecker/status/1864705413624496294)), allowing these kinds of laws 

Only after the motion passed parliament, it gained a decent amount of negative attention [in the media](https://nos.nl/artikel/2547828-berouw-extra-uitleg-en-vingerwijzen-in-kamer-na-opschudding-over-vvd-migrantenonderzoek). In response, some parties withdrew their support for the motion (perhaps more out of fear for losing their voters than out of genuine understanding and regret).

\* The motion does not mention any restrictions towards what kind of data should be collected, that privacy will be protected, or who "people with a migration background" are. I understand that a motion should not go too much into detail, but still, I would expect some mention of limitations towards the collection process.

# The freeze of asylum requests from Syrian refugees
on December 9th 2024, ....I still need to finish this.
