title: 'Sleepwalking'

Things I did or said while sleepwalking:
- Say "miauw miauw miauw" (cat sounds)
- Try to get into someone else's sleeping bag (while they were sleeping inside it)
- Attacking my girlfriend because I thought she was a witch
- "There's a fire, we have to go"
- Try to clean my imaginary kitesurf equipment
- "Stop the boat!"
- Opening the curtains because I saw Santa Klaus
- Flicking a light switch on and off many times in the kitchen
